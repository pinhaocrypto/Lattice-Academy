# Lattice-Academy

Lattice Academy is a comprehensive educational resource focused on lattice-based cryptography for Chinese speakers. This project is designed to address the growing need for quantum-resistant cryptography—especially with Ethereum's transition—by filling the gap of Chinese-language educational materials.

晶格 Academy 是一個晶格密碼學的中文學習資源。此專案主要是為了填補中文語言的學習資源，並幫助中文人士可以更容易的學習，使其可以在 Ethereum 過渡到抗量子 Ethereum 的過程更容易加入一起貢獻。

## Project Overview

Quantum-resistant cryptography is becoming more critical as technology evolves. However, there is a lack of resources in Chinese for those interested in learning about lattice-based cryptography. Lattice Academy aims to:

- Teach the mathematics behind lattice cryptography.
- Explain the security concepts used in these cryptographic systems.
- Phase one 
    - Introduce the  ML-KEM(Kyber) algorithm with hands-on coding practice that aligns with the official ML-KEM(Kyber) implementation.
- Phase two
    - Expand to cover advanced schemes such as Falcon and Dilithium.
- Phase three
    - Other cryptography primitive of lattice-based cryptography
    - Other applications of lattice-based cryptography
    - Optimizations for lattice-based cryptography

- **基礎數學：**  
  提供晶格密碼學所需的數學知識

- **解析安全概念：**  
  說明這些密碼系統中所涉及的安全性原理和機制

- **第一階段：**  
  - 介紹 ML-KEM（Kyber）演算法，並配合實作練習（使用 Python 並與官方實作保持一致），幫助學習者理解

- **第二階段：**  
  - 擴展至簽章系統，例如 Falcon 與 ML-DSA（Dilithium）

- **第三階段：**    
  - 如何做晶格的優化（例如：快速乘法）
  - 介紹更多 Lattice-based cryptography 的應用（例如 SNARK, 聚合簽章, 折疊方案）
